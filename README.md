# React Portfolio

## Overview

As a web developer, being an active participant in the developer community is essential. Having a dedicated space to showcase your work, whether you're applying for jobs or collaborating with other developers, is crucial. This portfolio, built with React, is designed to help me stand out by using the latest technologies.

The application is deployed on Netlify, following best practices for modern web development.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Application Overview

The portfolio is built using Vite and React, and it includes the following components:

- **Header**: A single header component that appears across multiple pages.
- **Navigation**: A navigation component within the header that uses `Link` components from `react-router-dom` to conditionally render the different sections of the portfolio.
- **Project**: A reusable project component that is featured in the Portfolio section.
- **Footer**: A footer component that appears on every page.

**Note**: While the contact form doesn't store data at this stage, it includes validation features. Future updates will integrate back-end functionality.

### Featured Projects

Each project in the portfolio includes:

- A visual of the deployed application.
- The project's title.
- A link to the live application.
- A link to the GitHub repository.

### Design Considerations

The portfolio is designed with a mobile-first approach and incorporates a unique color palette, ensuring readability and reducing eye strain. Animations and React component libraries may also be included for enhanced user experience.
